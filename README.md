# Simple Folder Syncer

The Simple Folder Syncer is a thin wrapper around the Windows program "Robocopy". Robocopy is used
to mirror one folder to another. The reason for this wrapper is to make the exclude handling
a little bit easier and narrow the program down to only syncing folders.


## Prerequisites

* Robocopy (should acutally be available on every Windows machine)


## Configuration

The configuration of the Simple Folder Syncer is done via a configuration file exclusively. No CLI parameters are supported yet.

The configuratoin file must be located under `%HOME%/folder_sync_config.yaml`

The content of the file looks like this:

```yaml
---
source: C:\Users\foo
target: Z:\
create_last_sync_result_file: true
exclude_root_source_hidden_entries: true
exclude_paths:
  - C:\Users\foo\Downloads
  - C:\Users\foo\OneDrive
```

| Field    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| source  | The directory which should be mirrored to the target. Only the content of the source is mirrored, not the directory iteslf.    |
| target | The target directory where the content of the source directory should be mirrored to. |
| exclude_root_source_hidden_entries    | If set to true, hidden entries in the root of the source directory are excluded from the sync. This does not affect hidden entries in any subdirectory of the source. |
| create_last_sync_result_file    | If set to true, a file named `last_sync_result.txt` is created in the target directory. The file contains a summary of the last sync run |
| exclude_paths    | A list of additional paths to be excluded from the sync. Currently, no support for wildcards is provided. Excluded paths will get deleted in the target. |


## Limitations

* Currently only Windows is supported
